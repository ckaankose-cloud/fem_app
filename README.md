🏗️ MATLAB Truss FEA Suite

A comprehensive 2D Finite Element Method (FEM) package featuring an interactive GUI for structural analysis, optimization, and mesh discretization.

🌟 Overview

This repository contains a unified mini-FE package developed in MATLAB to analyze arbitrary truss structures. It covers the full simulation pipeline: Pre-processing (geometry & BCs), Processing (stiffness assembly & solving), and Post-processing (result visualization).

🛠️ Key Features

Interactive GUI: Built-in interface for node/element generation and real-time visualization.

Modular Analysis:
* Generic Solver: Handles displacement and force boundary conditions.
* Bridge Optimizer: Dedicated tool for finding optimal truss configurations.
* Domain Discretization: Simulates square domains with/without holes (circular, rhombus, etc.) using truss elements.
* Beam Modeling: Discretizes beams of varying heights and widths into truss networks.

Post-Processor: Includes stress contour mapping, magnified deformation views, and undeformed vs. deformed overlays.
